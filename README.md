## Introduction

Causal Language Models (LMs) play a crucial role in various natural language processing tasks. GRPO is a powerful tool that can enhance the performance of LMs by applying graph regularization techniques. In this repository, we leverage weighted reward functions to fine-tune the optimization process and Optuna for automating hyperparameter tuning.

## Features

- **GRPO Integration**: Incorporates the Graph Regularized Projection Operator to improve the performance of Causal Language Models.
- **Weighted Reward Functions**: Utilizes weighted reward functions for fine-tuning and optimization.
- **Optuna Hyperparameter Tuning**: Implements Optuna for automated hyperparameter tuning, enhancing efficiency and effectiveness.
